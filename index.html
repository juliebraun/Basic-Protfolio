			<p>	Hi, my name is Julie and I am complete Rook to coding but stoked to be learning. Atlanta native, recent transplant to the local Denver scene and enjoying every minute of it. For the last five years I have been working my way up the sales executive ladder and am hoping to make a career change after this course. <br> <br> I have an undergradute degree in Operations Management from Georgia Southern University and am currently enrolled in the University of Denver's six month long, full-stack web development bootcamp. I attend classes every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday for a combine total of 10 hours in the classroom along with dedicating about 15-20 hours of outside the classroom to completing my corsework. <br><br>When I'm not crying in front of my computer journeying through this emorional rollarcoaster called development bootcamp, you'll find me hiking with my dog, reading, boarding, fishing, or at a concert. <br><br> I am a sponge. Let's talk code! </p>
